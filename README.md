# Plutus UI

> I download the  Web Boilerplate online with React, Redux, and TypeScript to bootstrap development.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

## Getting started

A Node.js 8.0.0+ setup with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is recommended.

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# ...or if you'd like to use npm instead
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
yarn start

# build for production
yarn build
```
